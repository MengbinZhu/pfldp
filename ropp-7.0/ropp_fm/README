		     ROPP_FM Package Release V7.0
		    ------------------------------

The ropp_fm module is a package of software and supporting files for the
forward  modelling of profiles of bending angles and refractivity from NWP
model profiles, whether on height- or pressure-based vertical coordinates.

ropp_fm forms one module of the Radio Occultation Processing Package (ROPP)
which is a key deliverable of the ROM SAF. The ROPP 1D-Var retrieval
(ropp_1dvar module) is based on these forward models. The package depends on
utility routines in the ropp_utils module. The sample test
programs also interface with data files using the ropp_io module. Users 
wishing to build only those parts of the ropp_fm code with no ropp_io 
dependencies need not install the ropp_io module. Please refer to the
installation guides of those modules for further dependencies.

See the ROPP Release Notes html file provided with the main ROPP download
tarfile for an overview and instructions for installing this module with the 
build and configure tools provided with ROPP. 

See the README.unix and README.cygwin files for more detailed installation 
instructions and tips for experienced developers. See file MANIFEST for the 
complete list of files in the distribution package and the COPYRIGHT file for 
copyright information. The file INSTALL contains generic instructions for the 
configure script.
