ROPP_FM data files for release Version v7.0
-------------------------------------------

This directory contains a collection of data files used by ROPP_FM.

Notes on the data files in this directory:

bgr2009*.nc        - ECMWF short range forecast background profiles [91 level].
                     Available from ROM SAF archive http://www.romsaf.org/
ecmwf_*.nc         - ECMWF short range forecast background profiles [60 level].
FM_Scenarios.nc    - 5x FASCOD background profiles
ECMWF_*.nc         - Sample files containing 2D background fields for testing
	             the 2d operator

These files were created from ECMWF short range forecasts. The levels
are the ECMWF ones, called 'hybrid ECMWF' in order to indicate that
these are hybrid levels as used by the ECMWF model system (there might
be other NWP centres using hybrid vertical levels, with slightly
different definitions).
