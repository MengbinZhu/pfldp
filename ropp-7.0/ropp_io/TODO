			TODO list for ropp_io
			=====================

After v1.0:
-----------

 - conversion applications for EUMETSAT, UCAR and GFZ data formats 
   (one way only, e.g. pfs2ropp, gfz2ropp, ucar2ropp)
 - add support for 2d (occultation plane) and 3d (block around
   occultation) background data
 - add support (i.e., provide structures and write / read routines)
   for other data types (covariance / correlation matrices) (?)
 - add support (i.e., provide structures and write / read routines)
   for other data types (2d / 3d / 4d atmospheric fields) (?)
 - extend support for data thinning
 - add configurable netcdf variable names and missing value indicator,
   similar to configurable units (?)
 - make some netcdf variables optional (candidates: snr's, phases,
   impact parameters, bending angles which are all missing; additional
   humidity variables) (?)
