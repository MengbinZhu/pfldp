ROPP 1dVar Error Correlations for release Version v7.0
------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a collection of error correlation files and scripts 
which users may find helpful for setting up input to ROPP_1DVAR tools. 
Further details are provided in the ROPP User Guide (Part II).

N.B. The ROPP FM and 1DVAR routines assume input data are in ascending height
     order (i.e. array index 1 nearest surface). The required error correlation
     and covariance structures must therefore be also defined in this way.

Notes on the Fortran program files in this directory:

ropp_1dvar_add_bgr_error.f90    - Tool to add background pressure, temperature 
                                  and humidity error values to a ROPP format 
                                  netCDF file. Errors are read from the 'sigma'
                                  variable in an input background covariance
                                  matrix file.

ropp_1dvar_add_refrac_error.f90 - Tool to add refractivity observation error
                                  values to a ROPP netCDF file. A number of 
                                  different error models may be chosen. 
                                  Type 'ropp_1dvar_add_refrac_error -h' for
                                  further details.

ropp_1dvar_add_bangle_error.f90 - Tool to add bending angle observation error
                                  values to a ROPP netCDF file. A number of 
                                  different error models may be chosen. 
                                  Type 'ropp_1dvar_add_bangle_error -h' for
                                  further details.

Notes on the data files in this directory:

ropp_bg_ecmwf_error_corr_L91.nc - Background error correlation matrix in packed
				  form for the latest ECMWF model structure 
				  (91 levels). This file is suitable for input 
				  to the ROPP_1DVAR tools using '--bg-corr'
				  command line option with ECMWF backgrounds.
				  It is recommended that 1dVar tools are run 
				  with bg_covar_method = 'VSFC' config option.

ropp_bg_meto_error_corr_L70.nc	- Background error correlation matrix in packed
				  form for the latest Met Office model 
				  structure (70 levels). This file is suitable 
				  for input to the ROPP_1DVAR tools using 
				  '--bg-corr' command line option with Met 
				  Office backgrounds.
				  It is recommended that 1dVar tools are run 
				  with bg_covar_method = 'VSFC' config option.

ropp_bg_ecmwf_error_corr_L60.nc	- Background error correlation matrix in packed
				  form for the previous ECMWF model structure 
				  (60 levels). 
				  It is recommended that 1dVar tools are run 
				  with bg_covar_method = 'VSFC' config option.

ropp_bg_meto_error_corr_L50.nc	- Background error correlation matrix in packed
				  form for the previous Met Office model 
				  structure (50 levels). This file is suitable 
				  for input to the ROPP_1DVAR tools using 
				  '--bg-corr' command line option with Met 
				  Office backgrounds.
				  It is recommended that 1dVar tools are run 
				  with bg_covar_method = 'VSFC' config option.

ropp_ob_refrac_error_corr.nc	- Refractivity observation correlation matrix
				  in packed form. This file is suitable for 
				  input to the ropp_1dvar_refrac tool using 
				  '--obs-corr' command line option. 
				  It is recommended that 1dVar tools are run 
				  with either obs_covar_method = 'VSDC' or
				  obs_covar_method = 'VSFC' config options.

[N.B. It is generally assumed that bending angle observations are uncorrelated,
so it is recommended that the ropp_1dvar_bangle tool is run with errors 
specified with the VSDC configuration option.]
