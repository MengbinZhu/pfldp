Notes on the test files in this directory:

A basic check on the running of the 1D-Var stand-alone
application (ropp_1dvar_refrac_ec in ropp_1dvar/build) 
can be invoked by:

 > make test
 
This runs the test_1dvar.sh shell script, which:
a) runs the 1D-Var application using test files
   in the ropp_1dvar/data directory, and outputs a results
   file to that directory,
b) runs an IDL script to 
   - read the input (background) and results files,
   - calculate the mean & differences (ideally these
     should be zero, but some rounding error can be expected),
   - plots the mean difference profiles to a jpeg file,
c) displays the jpeg file using XV.

If all is well, the mean percentage differences should be, 
for all practical purposes, zero.

Files example_tests.log and example_tests.jpg are examples
of successful test output.
