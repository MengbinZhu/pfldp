		     ROPP_1DVAR Package Release V7.0
		    ---------------------------------

The ropp_1dvar module is a package of software and supporting files for the
retrieval - by the variational (1D-VAR) method - of pressure, temperature
and humidity (plus surface pressure) from profiles of bending angle or
refractivity, using background 'first guess' profile, e.g. from an NWP
model.

ropp_1dvar forms one module of the Radio Occultation Processing Package
(ROPP) which is a key deliverable of the ROM SAF. The ROPP 1D-Var
retrieval is based on the forward models implemented in the ropp_fm module.
These packages depend on utility routines in the ropp_utils module. The sample 
test programs also interface with data files using the ropp_io
module. Users wishing to build only those parts of the ropp_1dvar code with no 
ropp_io dependencies need not install the ropp_io module. Please refer to the 
installation guides of those modules for further dependencies.

See the ROPP Release Notes html file provided with the main ROPP download
tarfile for an overview and instructions for installing this module with the 
build and configure tools provided with ROPP. 
 
See the README.unix and README.cygwin files for more detailed installation 
instructions and tips for experienced developers. See file MANIFEST for the 
complete list of files in the distribution package and the COPYRIGHT file for 
copyright information. The file INSTALL contains generic instructions for the 
configure script.
