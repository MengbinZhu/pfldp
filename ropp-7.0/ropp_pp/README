		     ROPP_PP Package Release V7.0
		    ------------------------------

The ropp_pp module is a package of software and supporting files for the 
processing of profiles of L1 and L2 channel excess phase or bending angles 
measured during a radio occultation to compute ionospheric corrected bending
angle and refractivity profiles.  It also contains a tool to calculate 
tropopause height from bending angles, refractivities, dry temperatures and/or
banckground temperatures.

ropp_pp forms one module of the Radio Occultation Processing Package (ROPP)
which is a key deliverable of the ROM SAF. The package relies on utility 
routines in the ropp_utils module. The sample test programs interface 
with data files using the ropp_io module. Users wishing to build only those 
parts of the ropp_pp code with no ropp_io dependencies need not install the 
ropp_io module. Please refer to the installation guides of those modules for 
further dependencies. 

See the ROPP Release Notes html file provided with the main ROPP download
tarfile for an overview and instructions for installing this module with the 
build and configure tools provided with ROPP. 
 
See the README.unix and README.cygwin files for more detailed installation 
instructions and tips for experienced developers. See file MANIFEST for the 
complete list of files in the distribution package and the COPYRIGHT file for 
copyright information. The file INSTALL contains generic instructions for the 
configure script.
