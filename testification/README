1. The program still need the subroutine of calculating the inverse of the matrix. Solved only for the Cube matrix.
2. The dimension of the state vector and other vectors need to be larger, which is now only 1.
3. If we increase the dimension of the vectors, we will get more problems than the situation of only 1 dimension.
